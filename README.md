Materials for R trainings I've done.

* intro-R

    An R proof of concept, with self-contained examples for creating MS Word documents, HTML presentations and reports, mass producing documents and presentations, and creating web applications.

    If you are using R for the first time, you will need to download [R](https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/), selecting the appropriate operating system (Windows/Mac) at each step.

    Once you have installed R and RStudio, you will need to install the following R packages to run the examples:
    
    * `readr`
    * `tidyr`
    * `dplyr`
    * `leaflet`
    * `ggplot2`
    * `ggvis`
    * `googleVis`
    * `shiny`

    Do this by running the following code in the prompt:

    `install.packages(c("readr", "tidyr", "dplyr", "leaflet", "ggplot2", "ggvis", "googleVis", "shiny"))`
